# 🚀 30 Days of Laravel API — Beginner to Advanced (Practical Series)

This repository documents my **30-day deep dive into Laravel API development**, covering real-world concepts used to build scalable enterprise-grade systems.

As a Laravel developer working with large ERP projects, my goal in this series is to **revisit the fundamentals, master advanced API patterns, and sharpen backend skills** through consistent daily practice.

This repository contains **only practical Laravel code and daily exercises**, without LinkedIn or Medium content.
